# ScratchTools #
(Will be) a collection of MegaApuTurkUltra's programs for batch operations involving Scratch.

Note: all jars in `dist/` are entirely self-contained thanks to the magic of Eclipse auto-library-unpacking.

## Follower List Generator ##
Generates a sprite2 file with avatars and details of a given user's followers.  
Usage:
```bash
java -jar "dist/FollowerListGen.jar" <username> <output file name>
```

## Visualizer Generator ##
Generates a project with a visualization of a given audio file. Additional instructions for setting up the project are in the generated Scratch project file.  
Usage: Install onto a local webserver or try it at http://aputurk.tk/ScratchTools/visualization/
